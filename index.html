    <h2>Why Mac Miller?</h2>
<h3>Why was Mac Miller one of the best?</h3>
<p>
    Malcolm James McCormick (January 19, 1992 ‚Äì September 7, 2018), known professionally as Mac Miller, was an American rapper, singer, songwriter, and record producer from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Miller began his career in Pittsburgh's hip hop scene in 2007, at the age of fifteen. 
    Mac Miller brings a totally new feel to his already familiar voice and flow, adding to the new hip-hop/rap trend of using real instruments, as well as elements of jazz and classical music to his songs.

<p>
    Mac Miller‚Äôs music was easy to understand if you knew what situation he was in, and, in turn, was the reason why people liked him so much. Mac used being a part of the younger generation to his advantage to connect with fans and to give them something to relate to. Mac‚Äôs music showed that it went further than beats and rhymes; his music was a cure to anyone going through what he did. 
    Miller‚Äôs music was universal. He created his music in a way where anyone could interpret it the way they wanted, as long as it helped them. Whether it‚Äôs the beat, lyric flow, or rhymes, Mac Miller‚Äôs objective was to spread positivity through music, which is why he was so loved in the hip-hop scene.

        <h4>Small Worlds</h4>
        <p>

Ultimately, the song encourages listeners to ‚Äúhold on‚Äù and keep their eyes to the sky in order to find hope and joy amidst their struggles.

            And I just wanna ball..."</p>

        <h4>Jet Fuel</h4>
        <p>
            The song "Jet Fuel" by Mac Miller is an uplifting and empowering anthem about resilience and determination in the face of adversity. The chorus embodies this message as it proclaims that he has the strength to keep going no matter what, and will never run out of "jet fuel."

        <p>"Yeah
            Used to wanna be a super hero
            Fly around with a cape catching bad guys
            Now my head underwater
            But I ain't in the shower and I ain't getting baptised
            To the good and the bad times
            All the cuts, broken bones and the black eyes.. "</p>
