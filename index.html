    <h2>Why Mac Miller?</h2>
<h3>Why was Mac Miller one of the best?</h3>
<p>
    Malcolm James McCormick (January 19, 1992 â€“ September 7, 2018), known professionally as Mac Miller, was an American rapper, singer, songwriter, and record producer from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Miller began his career in Pittsburgh's hip hop scene in 2007, at the age of fifteen. 
    Mac Miller brings a totally new feel to his already familiar voice and flow, adding to the new hip-hop/rap trend of using real instruments, as well as elements of jazz and classical music to his songs.

    Mac Millerâ€™s music was easy to understand if you knew what situation he was in, and, in turn, was the reason why people liked him so much. Mac used being a part of the younger generation to his advantage to connect with fans and to give them something to relate to. Macâ€™s music showed that it went further than beats and rhymes; his music was a cure to anyone going through what he did. 
    Millerâ€™s music was universal. He created his music in a way where anyone could interpret it the way they wanted, as long as it helped them. Whether itâ€™s the beat, lyric flow, or rhymes, Mac Millerâ€™s objective was to spread positivity through music, which is why he was so loved in the hip-hop scene.
