    <h2>Why Mac Miller?</h2>
<h3>Why was Mac Miller one of the best?</h3>
<p>
    Malcolm James McCormick (January 19, 1992 September 7, 2018),[1] known under the professional name Mac Miller, was an American rapper, singer, songwriter, and record producer. He was also noted under the pseudonym Larry Fisherman.

In early 2010, Miller signed a record deal with Pittsburgh-based indie record label Rostrum Records. Later, he began recording his first studio album, Blue Slide Park, and released it on November 8, 2011. The album debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200, making it the first independently distributed debut album to top the chart since rap duo Tha Dogg Pound's album, Dogg Food, in 1995.

    In early 2013, Miller launched REMember Music, his own record label imprint. It was named after a friend who died.

    Miller's second album, Watching Movies with the Sound Off, was released on June 18, 2013. In January 2014, Miller announced he was no longer signed to Rostrum Records. In October 2014, it was reported Miller signed a record deal for him and his label REMember (with Warner Bros. Records).
    
    Miller died of an accidental drug overdose on September 7, 2018 at the age of 26. The cause of death was because Miller had mixed Fentanyl with Cocaine.
